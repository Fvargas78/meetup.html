            <p>04/24/2021<br> I joined the  Flatiron School group, because they are pretty active in their meetings and because they offer FREE beginner-friendly events designed to introduce you to the in-demand fields of web development, coding & data science. for this virtual beginner coding workshop, the participants learned the basic building blocks of a website and how to style them. No previous coding experience needed. It was a great class, where i put in practice some of the core concepts of HTML (tags, elements, and attributes), and the basics of CSS (selectors, properties, and values) and some Javascript.Flatiron meetings usually happens twice a week.</p>

         I was courious about this event, because for someone like me, new in the programing industry, a lot of people recommend Ruby, but i did not know what Ruby is until i attended this meeting. After this introductory workshop, i learned that Ruby is an open-source and is freely available on the Web, but it is subject to a license, Ruby is a general-purpose, interpreted programming language, Ruby can be embedded into Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). and some other features.</p>

            <p>05/15/2021<br> I attended this workshop for learners with little to no JavaScript experience (complete beginners), because i think is importart to start getting involved in what i need to learn for my next class at City College. I recommedend this class to everyone who is interested to learn more about coding, not matter how much experience you might have.</p>
